# 2026 Ecclesial Calendar for the Byzantine Catholic Church in America

## Overview

This repository contains CSV files for each month of the 2026 liturgical year for the Byzantine Catholic Church in America, based on the official calendar published by Byzantine Seminary Press, Pittsburgh, PA.

## How the CSVs Were Produced

The CSV files were generated by digitizing scanned images of the official 2026 Byzantine Catholic Calendar:

1. **Source Material**: Physical calendar pages were scanned as JPEG images (front and back for each month), stored in the `scans/` directory with naming convention `2026-MM_monthname_MMa_front.jpeg` and `2026-MM_monthname_MMb_back.jpeg`.

2. **Data Extraction**: An AI assistant (Claude) analyzed each pair of scanned images to extract:
   - Calendar grid data from the front page (dates, feast names, scripture readings, tones, fasting indicators)
   - Detailed saint biographies and historical notes from the back page
   - Special remarks and rubrical notes

3. **CSV Structure**: Each monthly CSV contains the following columns:
   - `Date` - Full date (e.g., "Thursday, October 1, 2026")
   - `Day Name` - Feast name(s) and saint commemorations (pipe-delimited for multiple)
   - `Readings` - Epistle and Gospel readings (format: `Epistle|Gospel`, semicolon-separated for multiple readings)
   - `Tone` - Octoechos tone for Sundays (e.g., "Tone 1" through "Tone 8")
   - `Is Holy Day?` - TRUE/FALSE
   - `Is Fasting?` - TRUE/FALSE (simple abstinence days)
   - `Is Solemn Day?` - TRUE/FALSE (major feasts)
   - `Is Simple Holy Day?` - TRUE/FALSE
   - `Is Prefestive?` - TRUE/FALSE
   - `Is Postfestive Celebration?` - TRUE/FALSE
   - `Beginning of the Week Description` - Week after Pentecost designation
   - `About Today` - Detailed saint information from back page
   - `Remarks` - Special liturgical notes
   - `Iconography URL` - (reserved for future use)
   - `Iconography Caption` - (reserved for future use)
   - `Further Reading` - (reserved for future use)
